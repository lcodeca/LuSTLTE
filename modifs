inet/src/radio/ChannelControl.h
-------------------------------
changed modifiers to public. not exactly elegant.
-> should be removed before public release

simulte/src/stack/mac/layer/LteMacEnb.cc
----------------------------------------
added harq buffer clear into deleteQueues method

simulte/src/stack/mac/scheduler/LteSchedulerEnbUl.cc
----------------------------------------------------
removed RunTimeError thrown in reception schedule, seems to occur once per client after handover
-> should be fixed before public release, probably caused by an old harqbuffer entry that was not removed soon enough

simulte/src/stack/phy/ChannelModel/LteRealisticChannelModel.cc
--------------------------------------------------------------
Removed RunTimeErrors on distance>5000m
-> this should be debated, and a disconnect mode should be added

simulte/src/stack/phy/layer/LtePhyBase.cc
-----------------------------------------
sendBroadcast method & removed no phy listeners error, since the majority of our eNBs don't have connections at the start of the simulation

simulte/src/stack/phy/layer/LtePhyEnb.cc
-----------------------------------------
Start broadcast scheduling in initialize, catch exception on feedback due to remote/reporting set inaccuracies


simulte/src/stack/phy/layer/LtePhyUe.cc
---------------------------------------
Added Dwell Time logging and removal from old master in handover method

simulte/src/stack/phy/layer/LtePhyUe.h
--------------------------------------
Add Dwell Time vectors

veins/...
---------
These modifications should all be optional, only have to verify that the try/catch block in HeterogeneousToLTE.cc can be removed safely
